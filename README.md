# Lift simulation

In an experiment investigating the impact of elevator capacities on handling influxes of waiting individuals, it was found that elevators with a capacity of 7 individuals were most effective in maintaining low and stable queues over time, compared to capacities of 2, 4, and 5. This suggests that larger elevator capacities can prevent extreme scenarios like long wait times and overcrowding, even under random and variable people inflows.
